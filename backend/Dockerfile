# BUILDER # 
# ---- Docker container built in 2 stages â€“ the Builder stage and the Final stage
# use this Dockerfile to prepare our container before it is up and running our django_app 
# as one of the services for docker-compose. 
# Since a container is nothing but a stripped-down version of Linux, 
# we would need to prepare it before it is ready to run our django_app. 
# This is what all the steps in the Dockerfile define. Some other parameters 
# would be defined in the docker-compose file
